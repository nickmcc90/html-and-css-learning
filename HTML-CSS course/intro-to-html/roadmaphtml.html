<!--This whole document is going to be comment, just in case we forget how to do html and css




1. Start with the doctype element and the html structure, <html>, <head>, <body>.
2. Create the <style> and <title> inside the <head>
3. Create what you want in the body, look to past lessons to see how to do search bars, "input"; buttons,
images, and effects in the <head> like shadows, moving, centering, opacity, etc.
