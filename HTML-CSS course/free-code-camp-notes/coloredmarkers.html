.marker {
  width: 200px;
  height: 25px;               When the shorthand margin property has two values, it sets margin-top and margin-bottom to the first value, and left and right to the second value.
  background-color: red;
  margin: 10px auto;

<div class="one marker"></div>      #classes with a space in them have two or more classes. We have a class of one and a class of marker. They can both be individually referenced in styling. Later classes can override beginning classes.
