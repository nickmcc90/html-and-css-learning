.marker {
  width: 200px;
  height: 25px;               When the shorthand margin property has two values, it sets margin-top and margin-bottom to the first value, and left and right to the second value.
  background-color: red;
  margin: 10px auto;
}


<div class="one marker"></div>      #classes with a space in them have two or more classes. We have a class of one and a class of marker. They can both be individually referenced in styling. Later classes can override beginning classes.

Hexadecimal colors (base 16 values) go from 1-9 then A-F, with 00 being the least and FF being the most.

.blue {
  background-color: hsl(240, 100%, 50%);      The CSS hsl function accepts 3 values: a number from 0 to 360 for hue, a percentage from 0 to 100 for saturation, and a percentage from 0 to 100 for lightness.

If you imagine a color wheel, the hue red is at 0 degrees, green is at 120 degrees, and blue is at 240 degrees.
Saturation is the intensity of a color from 0%, or gray, to 100% for pure color. You must add the percent sign % to the saturation and lightness values.
Lightness is how bright a color appears, from 0%, or complete black, to 100%, complete white, with 50% being neutral.

#### Linear-gradient creates an image element, and is usually paired with the background property which can accept an image as a value.

background: linear-gradient(gradientDirection, color1, color2) # colors can be rgb, hsl, hex, keywords


.red {
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgb(255, 0, 0) 75%, rgb(0, 255, 0), rgb(0, 0, 255)); # color stops are percentages after the color argument that dictate where the color stops on the image.
}
