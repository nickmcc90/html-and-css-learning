<!--In the head element, nesting a meta element with an attribute of charset="utf-8" tells the browser how to enode characters for the page

An element can be referenced in the styling too, not just classes.
    <style>
      h1 {
        text-align: center;
      }
    </style>

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /> Having this nested inside your head element allows the page to look similar on mobile as it does on a desktop or laptop.


body {
  background-color: brown; This is how to make a whole page one color.
}


A massive div element inside of the body element having a width of 80% in the styling means that the div element has a width relative to 80% of its parent element, the body.


  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto; This is centering something.



body {
  background-image: url(https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-cafe/beans.jpg)
}

article elements have common elements in them too. They can be nested inside section elements.


.item p {
  display: inline-block; You can attack all p elements within a certain class with this dual syntax shown here.
}


.flavor {
  text-align: left;
  width: 75%;
}                           This right here is teaching a whack way of designing, but the goal here is to have flavor text on the left and price text on the right.

.price {
  text-align: right;
  width: 25%;
}
